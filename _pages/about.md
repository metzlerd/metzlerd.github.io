I'm a Senior Staff Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/),
where I lead a group of research scientists and software engineers. Our work focuses
on the foundations of generative AI and language modeling, with an emphasis on safety,
factuality, and retrieval/ranking. My teams' research has been instrumental in major
launches across Gemini, Search, Cloud, and Chrome.

My personal research interest lies at the intersection of generative AI models and
information retrieval (Search) systems.

I am a Distinguished Member of the ACM and a member of the
[SIGIR Academy](https://sigir.org/awards/sigir-academy/).
