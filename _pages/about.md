I'm a Senior Staff Research Scientist at Google. I currently lead a team in
[Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) focused on a variety of problems related to
generative AI and large  language models. My current research areas include language modeling
foundations, generative information retrieval, trust and safety, information quality,
factuality, and efficiency.
