I'm a Senior Staff Research Scientist at Google. I currently lead a team in
[Google DeepMind's](https://deepmind.google/) Generative AI unit focused on a variety of
problems related to large language models, including modeling foundations (model
architectures, data, evals), model trustworthiness, and generative information retrieval.

I am personally interested in research topics involving the interplay between generative AI
models and Search (information retrieval) systems.
