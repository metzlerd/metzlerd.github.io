My current research areas include language modeling foundations, safety, factuality, and retrieval/ranking.

To get a technical sense of my (and my teams') research, see my [Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bmXpOd8AAAAJ&hl=en)
or my [CV](../files/metzler-cv.pdf). Furthermore, below are links to corporate blog posts, YouTube videos,
and press articles that provide a different perspective on the broader impact of the research.
